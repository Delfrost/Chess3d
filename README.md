Chess3D incorporates several advanced data structures and algorithms to ensure optimal performance and an engaging gameplay experience:

📊 Arrays and Matrices → The chessboard is represented as an 8×8 matrix, efficiently tracking piece positions.

🔗 Graphs → The game logic treats the board as a graph, where each piece has valid move sets based on edges between nodes.

⚡ Hash Maps → Used to cache previously computed moves, speeding up AI decision-making.

🔄 Stacks → Implemented for the undo feature, storing previous game states so players can revert moves when needed.
